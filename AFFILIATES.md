2. **Get some organic traffic** (launch, share, basic SEO)

4. **Update links once approved**

## Application Strategy

### What You'll Need:

1. **Traffic stats** (even small numbers help):
   - Google Analytics screenshot
   - "500 unique visitors/month" sounds better than "just launched"

2. **Site description**:
   ```
   BetSorted is a clean, trustworthy comparison site for South African sports 
   bettors. We provide honest reviews, side-by-side comparisons, and SA-specific 
   guidance (payment methods, data-free apps, etc.). Our audience is South African 
   sports bettors looking for their first betting site or considering switching.
   ```

3. **Marketing plan**:
   - SEO (targeting "best betting sites south africa", etc.)
   - Social media (Twitter/X for sports betting community)
   - Content marketing (betting guides, tips)

4. **Business details**:
   - Business name (or personal if no entity)
   - Email: alphaxasset@gmail.com (or preferred)
   - Tax details (if required)

### Commission Models Explained

**Revenue Share (most common):**
- You get 25-40% of net revenue from referred players, lifetime
- Best for long-term income
- Example: Player deposits R10,000, loses R2,000. You get 30% of R2,000 = R600

**CPA (Cost Per Acquisition):**
- One-time payment per qualified player (R500-R2,000)
- Faster payout but no recurring income
- Example: Refer 10 players, get R1,000 each = R10,000 upfront

**Hybrid:**
- Lower CPA + lower revenue share
- Example: R500 upfront + 15% revenue share

### Negotiation Tips

1. **Start with standard terms** - Don't negotiate until you have leverage (traffic)
2. **Track performance** - After 3-6 months, if you're driving good conversions, ask for better rates
3. **Volume matters** - "I'm driving 50+ signups/month, can we discuss 35% instead of 30%?"
